## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Xiâ€˜an Jiaotong-Liverpool University & University of Liverpool. Currently, I am working with Prof. Jia Wang, Xiaobo Jin, and Qiufeng Wang on LLM Safety and Transfer Learning. I'm working simultaneously with Prof. Yongfeng Zhang and Prof. Mengnan Du on explainability for LLM and multi-agent systems and with Assistant Professor Lingyao Li on NLP and urban informatics. Special thanks to my co-author, Mingyu Jin, for his leadership skills.
